# 2025-12-25 Update
Our goal is to make sure first that our codebase is in a working state

[x] poetry -> uv
[x] does everything run on latest python (3.14)?
[x] swap out non-working libs like selenium for playwright 
[ ] Make sure our docs are up-to-date

Our next priority is to make sure that our 2021 Taxes are migrated and are "locked"

[ ] This probably requires us to create an IMPLEMENTATION-taxyear-locking.md that let's us lockdown our cost-basis, etc for previous  years

We have to do 2022-2025 Transations...

[ ] Make sure we handle GMX and escrow transactions - consistent handling
[ ] Think about how we're calculating our interest?

Nice to have:
[ ] Track tax prepayments

Next Big Functionality
[ ] Daily Yield Tracking (see Spreadsheet)
